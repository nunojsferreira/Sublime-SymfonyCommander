If you need some Symfony code snippets in addition to this package just install [sublime-symfony2](https://github.com/raulfraile/sublime-symfony2). It is a great package for speed up your Symfony 2 development as well.

## Usage

### Command Palette

![Command Palette](http://pdaether.github.com/images/command_palette.jpg "Command Palette")

Open the Command Palette with the shortcut `Command+Shift+P` on OS X or `Control+Shift+P` otherwise.
Alternative you can open the Command Palette in the menu (_Tools -> Command Palette..._).

**Speed up tip:**

You don't need to type the complete command (`SymfonyCommander...`) in the Command Palette to get to to the right command.
For example if you type something short like `sccl` you get directly to the _SymfonyCommander cache:clear_ commands.

### Context menu or main menu

You can call the Symfony commands through the context menu of an file or the main menu `Tools -> SymfonyCommander`.

![Contextmenu](http://pdaether.github.com/images/contextmenu.jpg "Contextmenu")

### Shortcuts

SymfonyCommader has some shortcuts defined:

 - To switch between a Controller Action an the corresponding Template you can use `ctrl+alt+s` on Windows and Linux or `alt+super+s` on OS X. At the moment this only works, if the names of your Action an the corresponding template are matching the naming conventions and you are using Twig (for example _indexAction_ and _index.html.twig_).
 - To clear the cache in the development environment just type  `ctrl+alt+c` on Windows and Linux or `alt+super+c` on OS X.

 You can of cause change or add shortcuts in the user settings.

### Autocompletion

 With SymfonyCommander you get autocompletion for routes and service names while you are typing.

 In addition, there are two commands `SymfonyCommander Select Route` and `SymfonyCommander Select Service` in the Command Palette for selecting an entry with more Infos:

![Select a service](http://pdaether.github.com/images/select_a_container.jpg "Select a service")

![Select a route](http://pdaether.github.com/images/select_a_route.jpg "Select a route")

**Info:** For performance reasons the routes and service names are cached internally.
To flush the cache just call the command `SymfonyCommander Flush Cache` over the Command Palette.

## Install

### Installation with Package Control (recommended)

1. The easiest way to install SymfonyCommander is through Package Control, which can be found [here](http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/package_control).

2. After the installation of Package Control bring up the Command Palette (`Command+Shift+P` on OS X, `Control+Shift+P` otherwise). Select "Package Control: Install Package" and wait until the list with all available packages will appear. 

3. Than select "SymfonyCommander". 

Package Control will automatically keep SymfonyCommander up to date with the latest version.


### Installation with git

Clone this repository in your Sublime Packages directory which you can find here:

- OS X : `~/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 2/Packages/`
- Linux: `~/.Sublime Text 2/Packages/`
- Windows: `%APPDATA%/Sublime Text 2/Packages/`

## Configuration

### Global settings

Settings can be configured with a `SymfonyCommander.sublime-settings` file in your `User` folder.
You can copy the one provided in this package.

	{
		"php_command": "/usr/bin/php",
		"api_search_version": "master",
		"doc_search_version": "master"
	}

**php_command:** With `php_command` you can define where SymfonyCommander can find the php binary. If it is `false` than SymfonyCommader calls the Symfony console directly without php binary (works well on OS X an Linux).
Otherwise you can point `php_command` to the php binary path, for example `C:\php\php.exe` or `/usr/bin/php`.
The default is `false`.

**api_search_version:** This setting determines which version of the symfony api should be used for searching, could be `master` or something like `v2.0.14`. The default is `master`.

**doc_search_version:** This setting determines which version of the symfony online documentation should be used for searching, could be either `master` or `2.0`. The default is `master`.


### Project specific settings

SymfonyCommander tries to find the Symfony `app/console` script automatically. Therefor SymfonyCommander takes the active file an traverses the directory path up and searches for `app/console`.
This works in most cases.

Otherwise you have to tell SymfonyCommander where to find the console script on a project basis.
To point SymfonyCommander to the root directory of your Symfony installation you need to set this path in the Sublime Text Project file (_*.sublime-project_) under the _settings_-section.

	"settings":{
		"SymfonyCommander":{
			"base_directory": "/www/htdocs/your-symfony-project/"
		}
	}
